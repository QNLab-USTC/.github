## Our Team
Quantum Network Research Group was established in 2018 and is located at the University of Science and Technology of China (USTC). Our group is one of the earliest scientific research teams engaged in cutting-edge research on quantum networks in China. Our group is dedicated to the research of key technologies such as routing planning, request scheduling, and resource allocation for future quantum networking, and has published a series of representative theoretical results and independently developed a system-level quantum network simulation platform, which provides a complete set of solutions from the quantum operation, quantum network protocol stack, network deployment, and performance analysis for the problem that quantum networks are difficult to deploy and verify on a large scale.
